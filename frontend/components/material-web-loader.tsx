/**
 * Registers all @material/web custom element definitions on the client,
 * after hydration. Importing the definitions at module top level would
 * upgrade the elements before React hydrates, and Lit elements mutate
 * their own attributes on upgrade (e.g. aria-label -> data-aria-label),
 * which triggers hydration mismatch errors. Loading in an effect means
 * React hydrates the plain server-rendered tags first, then the elements
 * upgrade in place.
 *
 * `all.js` registers every non-labs component. Labs components (cards,
 * segmented buttons, etc.) must be added here individually, e.g.:
 *   import("@material/web/labs/card/elevated-card.js")
